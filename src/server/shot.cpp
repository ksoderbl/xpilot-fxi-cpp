/** \brief Moves a ball
 *
 * The new ball movement code since XPilot version 3.4.0 as made
 * by Bretton Wade.  The code was submitted in context diff format
 * by Mark Boyns.  Here is a an excerpt from a post in
 * rec.games.computer.xpilot by Bretton Wade dated 27 Jun 1995:
 *
 *     If I'm not mistaken (not having looked very closely at the code
 *     because I wasn't sure what it was trying to do), the original move_ball
 *     routine was trying to model a Hook's law spring, but squared the
 *     deformation term, which would lead to exagerated behavior as the spring
 *     stretched too far. Not really a divide by zero, but effectively producing
 *     large numbers.
 *
 *     When I coded up the spring myself, I found that I could recreate the
 *     effect by using a VERY strong spring. This can be defeated, however, by
 *     damping. Specifically, If you compute the critical damping factor, then
 *     you could have the cable always be the correct length. This makes me
 *     wonder how to decide when the cable snaps.
 *
 *     I chose a relatively strong spring, and a small damping factor, to make
 *     for a nice realistic bounce when you grab at the treasure. It also gives a
 *     fairley close approximation to the "normal" feel of the treasure.
 *
 *     I modeled the cable as having zero mass, or at least insignificant mass as
 *     compared to the ship and ball. This greatly simplifies the math, and leads
 *     to the conclusion that there will be no change in velocity when the cable
 *     breaks. You can check this by integrating the momentum along the cable,
 *     and the ship or ball.
 *
 *     If you assume that the cable snaps in the middle, then half of the
 *     potential energy goes to each object attached. However, as you said, the
 *     total momentum of the system cannot change. Because the weight of the
 *     cable is small, the vast majority of the potential energy will become
 *     heat. I've had two physicists verify this for me, and they both worked
 *     really hard on the problem because they found it interesting.
 *
 * End of post.
 *
 * Changes since then:
 *
 * Comment from people was that the string snaps too soon.
 * Changed the value (max_spring_ratio) at which the string snaps
 * from 0.25 to 0.30.  Not sure if that helps enough, or too much.
 *
 * \param ball	ball structure
