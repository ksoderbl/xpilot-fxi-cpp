/*
 * Wall collision detection and bouncing.
 *
 * The wall collision detection routines depend on repeatability
 * (getting the same result even after some "neutral" calculations)
 * and an exact determination whether a point is in space,
 * inside the wall (crash!) or on the edge.
 * This will be hard to achieve if only floating point would be used.
 * However, a resolution of a pixel is a bit rough and ugly.
 * Therefore a fixed point sub-pixel resolution is used called clicks.
