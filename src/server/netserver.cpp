/*
 * This is the server side of the network connnection stuff.
 *
 * We try very hard to not let the game be disturbed by
 * players logging in.  Therefore a new connection
 * passes through several states before it is actively
 * playing.
 * First we make a new connection structure available
 * with a new socket to listen on.  This socket port
 * number is told to the client via the pack mechanism.
 * In this state the client has to send a packet to this
 * newly created socket with its name and playing parameters.
 * If this succeeds the connection advances to its second state.
 * In this second state the essential server configuration
 * like the map and so on is transmitted to the client.
 * If the client has acknowledged all this data then it
 * advances to the third state, which is the
 * ready-but-not-playing-yet state.  In this state the client
 * has some time to do its final initializations, like mapping
 * its user interface windows and so on.
 * When the client is ready to accept frame updates and process
 * keyboard events then it sends the start-play packet.
 * This play packet advances the connection state into the
 * actively-playing state.  A player structure is allocated and
 * initialized and the other human players are told about this new player.
 * The newly started client is told about the already playing players and
 * play has begun.
 * Apart from these four states there are also two intermediate states.
 * These intermediate states are entered when the previous state
 * has filled the reliable data buffer and the client has not
 * acknowledged all the data yet that is in this reliable data buffer.
 * They are so called output drain states.  Not doing anything else
 * then waiting until the buffer is empty.
 * The difference between these two intermediate states is tricky.
 * The second intermediate state is entered after the
 * ready-but-not-playing-yet state and before the actively-playing state.
 * The difference being that in this second intermediate state the client
 * is already considered an active player by the rest of the server
 * but should not get frame updates yet until it has acknowledged its last
 * reliable data.
 *
 * Communication between the server and the clients is only done
 * using UDP datagrams.  The first client/serverized version of XPilot
 * was using TCP only, but this was too unplayable across the Internet,
 * because TCP is a data stream always sending the next byte.
 * If a packet gets lost then the server has to wait for a
 * timeout before a retransmission can occur.  This is too slow
 * for a real-time program like this game, which is more interested
 * in recent events than in sequenced/reliable events.
 * Therefore UDP is now used which gives more network control to the
 * program.
 * Because some data is considered crucial, like the names of
 * new players and so on, there also had to be a mechanism which
 * enabled reliable data transmission.  Here this is done by creating
 * a data stream which is piggybacked on top of the unreliable data
 * packets.  The client acknowledges this reliable data by sending
 * its byte position in the reliable data stream.  So if the client gets
 * a new reliable data packet and it has not had this data before and
 * there is also no data packet missing inbetween, then it advances
 * its byte position and acknowledges this new position to the server.
 * Otherwise it discards the packet and sends its old byte position
 * to the server meaning that it detected a packet loss.
 * The server maintains an acknowledgement timeout timer for each
 * connection so that it can retransmit a reliable data packet
 * if the acknowledgement timer expires.
